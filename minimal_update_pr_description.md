# Enhanced Terminal Environment (Minimal Update)

This PR enhances the existing terminal environment by adding better command support and integration with the current setup. Instead of replacing the existing implementation, this PR builds on what's already there.

## What's Changed

### 1. Enhanced `setup-enhanced-environment` Script

The existing `setup-enhanced-environment` script has been enhanced with:
- Better package management simulation
- Enhanced help system
- Color-enabled command wrappers
- Session keep-alive functionality

### 2. Added Terminal Enhancement Package

Added `enhanced-terminal.tar.gz` with essential command wrappers:
- Color-enabled `ls` and `grep`
- Formatted output for better readability

### 3. Minimal Dockerfile Changes

Modified `Dockerfile.flask` to include the enhancement package without changing the existing container behavior.

## How It Works

When a user connects to the terminal:
1. The existing user environment setup mechanism runs `setup-enhanced-environment`
2. The script now includes the enhanced commands from the package
3. Users immediately get better command support and color output

This approach enhances the existing functionality without replacing it, ensuring compatibility with the current system.

## Testing

This has been tested to ensure:
- Compatibility with the existing environment
- Proper color support for commands
- Improved help system functionality
