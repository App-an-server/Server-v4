# Port Binding Fix

This document explains the changes made to fix port binding issues with the terminal server on Render.

## Issues Addressed

1. **Port Already in Use**: The server sometimes failed to bind to the specified port because it was already in use
2. **Temporary Server Not Releasing Port**: The temporary health check server wasn't properly releasing the port
3. **Port 3000 Restrictions**: Some hosting providers restrict or use port 3000 for internal purposes
4. **Lack of Fallback Mechanism**: If the main port was unavailable, the server would fail without trying alternatives

## Changes Made

### 1. Changed Default Port

- Switched from port 3000 to port 8080, which is less commonly used by other services
- Updated all configurations to use the new default port

### 2. Improved Temporary Server

- Added better error handling in the temporary health check server
- Implemented port fallback logic to try alternative ports (8080, 8000)
- Improved connection handling with better logging
- Added proper cleanup with stronger process termination (SIGKILL)

### 3. Enhanced Diagnostics

- Added port availability checking before attempting to bind
- Shows detailed logs about the port binding process
- Detects and reports if a port is already in use

### 4. Added Main Server Fallback Logic

- Main Gunicorn server now tries alternative ports if the primary port fails
- Added a retry mechanism with multiple port options
- Increased log verbosity to debug level during startup

### 5. Socket Cleanup

- Added cleanup of stale socket files
- Improved process termination handling

## Testing These Changes

After deploying these changes, you should see:

1. More detailed logs about port binding in the Render logs
2. The server should successfully bind to a port, even if the primary port is unavailable
3. Health checks should pass as the temporary server will bind to an available port

If issues persist, the enhanced logs will provide better diagnostic information to further troubleshoot the problem.
