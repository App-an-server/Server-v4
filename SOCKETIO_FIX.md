# Socket.IO Compatibility Fix

This document explains the changes made to restore Socket.IO functionality in the terminal server.

## Problem

Recent port binding fixes inadvertently broke the Socket.IO functionality by changing how the server starts. Specifically:

1. **Server Startup Method**: We switched from Flask-SocketIO's built-in server to Gunicorn, which doesn't properly support WebSockets without additional configuration.

2. **Port Handling**: We changed port binding logic and default ports, which affected the WebSocket connections.

3. **Complex Startup Process**: The temporary server and port fallback mechanism interfered with Socket.IO's ability to bind to the correct port.

## Solution

The fix restores the original Socket.IO functionality while keeping some of the useful diagnostics:

### 1. Reverted to Flask-SocketIO's Native Server

Socket.IO requires its own server implementation to handle WebSocket connections properly. We've updated the entrypoint script to use:

```python
python run.py
```

This starts the Flask app with Socket.IO's built-in server, which properly handles WebSocket connections.

### 2. Restored Original Port Configuration

Socket.IO clients may have been configured to connect to the original port (3000), so we've:

- Restored the default port to 3000
- Kept port availability checking to detect conflicts
- Simplified the port binding process

### 3. Removed Complex Startup Mechanism

- Removed the temporary server that was interfering with Socket.IO
- Removed multi-port fallback that caused confusion
- Simplified the startup process while keeping useful diagnostics

## Expected Behavior

After applying these changes:

1. WebSocket connections should work properly again
2. Background workers should function as expected
3. Real-time communication through Socket.IO should be restored
4. The server should still start properly on Render

## If Issues Persist

If you still experience issues with Socket.IO connections:

1. Check the server logs for specific Socket.IO related errors
2. Verify client connection URLs are using the correct port (3000)
3. Ensure the WebSocket protocol is properly supported by your hosting environment
